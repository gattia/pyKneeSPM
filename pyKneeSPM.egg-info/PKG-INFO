Description: # PyKneeSPM
        
        Python module to perform SPM (statistical parametric mapping) style analysis on 3D surface meshes of the knee
        
        # Introduction / Background
        This work is inspired by the brain imaging communities use of SPM to find "activations" in the brain, and the lack of 
        ways to find anatomically specific information about musculoskeletal joint health. Current methods use human defined 
        ROIs that may or may not be key regions of interest. 
        
        This package works under the premise that knee health information can be localized to the surface of the bone
        and that by registering bones together we can complete group statistics on these metrics. Examples include
        transferring cartilage thickness or T2 values to the bone surface directly.
